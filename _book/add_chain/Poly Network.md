#### Protocol for Joining the Poly Cross-chain Ecosystem

The poly cross-chain ecosystem provides a platform for various chains to interact and transfer data and conduct cross-chain transactions. Any chain can freely join the ecosystem. However, the chains that support smart contracts can interact and share all kinds of information between chains, while the chains that do not support smart contracts are limited to cross-chain asset transfer.
