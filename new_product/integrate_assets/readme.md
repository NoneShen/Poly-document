<h1 align="center">Import New Assets</h1>

This section purposes to help you import assets into Poly Network, containing two guidelines of importing tokens and NFT.

Considering that Poly Network has already included most mainstream chains, check whether your project supports the 
existing [chains](../../Core_Smart_Contract/Contract/MainNet.md#contract-index-chain-chain-id) . If not, please import your chain first.
